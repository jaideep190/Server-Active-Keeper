# API Pinger

API Pinger is a simple React application designed to prevent free-tier hosted APIs from spinning down due to inactivity. It periodically sends GET requests to specified APIs to keep them active.

## Features

- Pings multiple APIs at regular intervals
- Configurable ping interval
- Easy to add new APIs to monitor
- Displays last ping time for each API
